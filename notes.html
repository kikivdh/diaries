    <p> "The Young-Girl does not mind miming submission here and there: BECAUSE SHE KNOWS IT DOMINATES.<br>
         Something in this brings her in line with the masochism that has long been taught to women, which makes them cede the SIGNS of power to
          men in order to recover, internally, the certitude that they possess them in reality."</p>

"To this end, art/archaeology is an invitation to use artefacts, traces, features, analyses<br> 
and perceptions from the past as if they were fresh, raw materials, palettes and tools in our <br>
creation of original work that has political intention and impact. It is a search for new spaces <br>
in which to make work that is both of the past, but alsowholly in the present. One way to conceive <br>
of doing art/archaeology is through a three-step process: <mark>disarticulation</mark>, repurposing and disruption. "

        <b> "Art/Archaeology: the challenge</b><br><br>
        How is any of this archaeological, beyond the vague connection that is allowed at a subconscious level<br>
        of a past-in-the-present, or in addition to the thin recognition that objects that are disarticulated were<br>
        once of the past? Is the disarticulation-repurposingdisruption programme only applicable to contemporary art workers and work?<br>

        <br><br>
        One answer is that <mark>none of it is very archaeological.</mark> 
        Thus the work that takes place and its results and impacts occur in intellectual, disciplinary 
        and institutional contexts beyond the boundaries of archaeology as traditionally practised. This non-archaeologicality is part of the proposal."<br>

        "The proposal, therefore, is to be politically affective, to locate the past honestly in the politics of the present, to make the world a better place in which to
        live. In many ways, archaeology does this already in declaring the inherently political character of the past,
        its recovery and its deployment in the present. The suggestion made here is for an additional, complementary venture: <b>to disarticulate artefacts from their
        pasts and to release them into the contested dynamics of the present</b>, through the making of new creative
        works, not traditionally seen as historic or archaeological in form, display or intention. Hence, the proposal
        for disruption within an art/archaeology.""

          “We can express our feelings regarding the world around us <b> by poetic or by descriptive means.</b>
           I prefer to express myself metaphorically. Let me stress: metaphorically, not symbolically. A symbol
            contains within itself a definite meaning, certain intellectual formula, while metaphor is an image.
             An image possessing the same distinguishing features as the world it represents. An image — as opposed
              to a symbol — is indefinite in meaning. <mark>One cannot speak of the infinite world by applying tools that
               are definite and finite. We can analyse the formula that constitutes a symbol, while metaphor is
                a being-within-itself, it's a monomial. It falls apart at any attempt of touching it.”</mark>

          “It is obvious that art cannot teach anyone anything, since in four thousand years humanity has learnt nothing at all. We should long ago have become angels had we been capable of paying attention to the experience of art, and allowing ourselves to be changed in accordance with the ideals it expresses. Art only has the capacity, through shock and catharsis, to make the human soul receptive to good. It’s ridiculous to imagine that people can be taught to be good…Art can only give food – a jolt – the occasion – for psychical experience.”

        “Archive as Failed Futuristic Vision:<br><br>
        If Hirschhorn recovers radical figures in his archival work, Tacita Dean <b>recalls lost souls</b> in hers...
        
        Sebald surveys a
modern world so devastated by history as to appear “after nature”: many of its
inhabitants are “ghosts of repetition” (including the author) who seem at once
“utterly liberated and deeply despondent.”37 These remnants are enigmatic, but
they are enigmas without resolution, let alone redemption. Sebald even questions
the humanist commonplace about the restorative power of memory; the ambiguous epigraph of the first section of The Emigrants reads: “and the last remnants
memory destroys.”38 Dean also looks out on a forlorn world (often literally so in
her films, videos, and photographs), yet for the most part she avoids the melancholic fixation that is the price that Sebald pays for his courageous refusal of
redemptive illusion. The risk in her work is different: a romantic fascination with
“human failing.”39 But, within the “failed futuristic visions” that she recovers
archivally, there is also an intimation of the utopian—not as the other of reification (as in Hirschhorn) but as a concomitant of her archival presentation of the
past as fundamentally heterogeneous and always incomplete.40”

     <b>I think one of the primary characteristics of gifs is their repetition. Also, that they are low quality and thus very lightweight. Strange closed circuits.<br><br>
      <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20090725073539/http://www.geocities.com/survivor17/candlem.gif" style="width:50px;height:auto;"><br><br>
       
    There's something I can't let go of in these old(ish) 'memorial gifs', normally candles, wreaths, which burn or stay green forever on the screen. 
    As opposed to a real candle, which invariably ends. Kind of wrapping up that state of mourning- a signifier of rememberance, during the time that the candle is lit.
    When the candle doesn't go out, you can't forget. This is a significant contract to me. <br><br>And it's  this anti-amnesia gap which is difficult online. 
    Having to remember everything at once is to remember nothing at all, or to be cowed by time...not sure. I just find them strange and sad, and I think the key is this 
    repetition with no variation. Even grief's horseshoe is absent. <br><br><br>

    And actually I think that if pain (as a state) has value, it's all in the amnesia. How you can't quite ever remember the exact feeling and countours of the state- 
    the impulse which allows women to give birth again, because they are allowed to forget the pain of the first time. I imagine it like a silvery fish going out of sight. To be in a state and forget it: 
    to slough off pain, then remember it only in silhoutte... These gifs do a sort of innocent maintenance which is perhaps responsible, but never lets these states go. I think we are all entitled to some amnesiac spirit. 

  I suppose losing political memory is dangerous, but so is retaining everything.

  <i>Thinking about worlds within worlds...he describes the web as a world-bounding environment.
     Maybe part of the use of the internet and its more diaristic/esoteric uses is the 'positive alienation' 
     which might happen when you forced to re-make the boundaries of your identity (not reinforce them!) </i>

  <i>What about HYPOXIA?</i><br><br>
  ...no oxygen, no breath, thru paper?
  <br><br>
 Hypoxia being a lack of oxygen... I keep thinking about this taking place on paper...not sure how!

  <i>"Does everything that exists, exist to be presented and represented, to be mediated and remediated, to be communicated and translated?"</i>

  -Alexander R. Galloway, Eugene Thacker, McKenzie Wark, in Excommunication (2013).

I think there is definitely a case for silences or voids in the database! There is such a drive towards methodological reading, both in archives and on the net.
 Sometimes it sms as though the dreaminess of entries are driven out. Tbh I think that this kind of engagement w. archival material- on the level of desire, magnetism, dreams- is the most powerful. 
 Mystery might be a better way of getting people to look at things! An eerieness when things are a bit disjointed in a databse can be v. attractive. This might be what art adjacent representations have over on historical ones. So: use it!

  Have been thinking about this: <br><br>

  <i>All melodious poets shall be hoarse as street ballads,<br> when once the penetrating keynote of nature and spirit<br> is sounded–the earth-beat, sea-beat, heart-beat,<br>which make the tune to which the sun rolls, <br>and the globule of blood and the sap of the trees.</i>
  <br><br>
  -Emerson (?) quoted by Charles Ives, in Essay Before a Sonata. 

  <br><br>
  Tend to like the way he writes about the sun and different sounds... the 'beat' here.

 Thinking about making something to inter or bury.<br>
Like Roger Hiron's plane. Very beautiful.
